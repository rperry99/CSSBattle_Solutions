# CSS Battle Solutions

I want to keep a log of my solutions for CSS Battle in a non-minified format for future reference.

One of the goals on CSS Battle is to do the solutions in as little code as possible. I want to have a version of my code saved that uses a more practical, real world approach.

## CSS Battle

[CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/) is a website where you can participate in daily challenges or "Code Golf" where you try to do the challenge with the fewest possible characters.

You can find [my profile here](https://cssbattle.dev/player/rperry).
